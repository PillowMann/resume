    <h2>Summary of who I am and what I do at the moment</h2>
    <p>At the moment I work as a digital marketingspecialist at a marketing agency. My focus is on SEO and UX/UI design, but due to my experience and interests, I also help a lot of our clients in various areas, though mainly on their website. My main goal is to find out what strategy and path will lead my clients to their customers' wishes and needs. I base this on my knowledge and experience from my previous experience from other jobs and education. 
    </p>
    <p>I thrive in environments in which I can be creative and explore new possibilities for solving my daily tasks. I love to constantly learn something new through various courses, webinars, video and blog posts. Within the last few years, front end web development and UX/UI Design in particular have caught my attention. At the same time, I follow the latest trends in digital marketing.
        I have also held a bunch of workshops for clients, that want to learn more about SEO and its effect on Google.</p>
